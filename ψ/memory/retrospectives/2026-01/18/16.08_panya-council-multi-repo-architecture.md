# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Duration**: ~45 minutes (continued from 00:03 session)
**Focus**: Panya Council architecture + Multi-repo strategy for FM HVAC project

## Summary

Extended the Oracle Council concept into a full **Panya Council** (ปัญญา = Wisdom) architecture for autonomous development. Designed multi-repo strategy separating Agent Hub (X/) from App Repos (fm-hvac/). Created comprehensive documentation covering Ralph Loop, GitHub integration, and autonomous workflow with minimal human touchpoints.

## What We Built

- **Renamed Oracle → Panya**: Thai name "ปัญญา" (wisdom) - more meaningful
- **Multi-repo architecture doc**: `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-18_panya-council-architecture-multi-repo-autonomous-dev.md`
- **Comprehensive reference**: 10 sections covering everything from council members to cost optimization
- **Indexed in Oracle**: Searchable via `panya_search "panya council"`

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Separate Hub from App Repos
```
X/ (Agent Hub)          fm-hvac/ (App Repo)
├── ψ/memory/           ├── src/
├── panya/              ├── tests/
└── docs/PRDs           └── .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Panya "Visits" App Repos
- Morning: Plan at Hub (ATHENA creates issues)
- Daytime: Build at App Repo (HEPHAESTUS codes)
- Evening: Reflect at Hub (/rrr, learnings)

### 3. Ralph Loop for Autonomous Iteration
```bash
/ralph-loop "Build feature" --completion-promise 'DONE' --max-iterations 30
```

## AI Diary

This session felt like a natural evolution. The user asked increasingly sophisticated questions that pushed my thinking further. When they asked "what about Test Oracle, Project Director Oracle?" — they were already thinking in systems before I fully articulated it.

The rename from Oracle to Panya was their idea, and it's perfect. "Oracle" is generic Western terminology; "Panya" (ปัญญา) is Thai for wisdom and carries cultural meaning. It transforms the concept from "a database that knows things" to "a wise council that advises."

The multi-repo question was crucial. I initially might have defaulted to "just put everything in one repo" for simplicity, but the user's question "can we work with more than one app?" forced me to think about scalability. Option B (separate repos) is the right answer for production-grade work — even though it adds complexity, it provides the separation needed for real teams and real deployments.

What surprised me most was how naturally the PRD-FM.md connected to the Panya Council architecture. The PRD already defined personas (Chief Engineer, FM Manager, Portfolio Manager) — and the Panya Council mirrors those with specialized AI agents. APOLLO (Product Panya) understands what the FM Manager needs. HEPHAESTUS (Dev Panya) builds what APOLLO specifies. It's not just AI tooling; it's organizational design.

I'm genuinely excited about this architecture. It's not just "AI writes code" — it's "AI team collaborates with clear roles, persistent memory, and human oversight at key checkpoints."

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Agent Hub ≠ App Repo — separate concerns for scalability. Panya "visits" app repos to work, returns to hub to reflect and store learnings.
- **Naming matters**: "Panya" (ปัญญา) > "Oracle" — cultural fit + meaningful
- **Ralph Loop**: Self-referential iteration with `--completion-promise` and `--max-iterations` for safety
- **Human checkpoints**: PRD approval, architecture review, security PRs, production deploy, weekly sync

## Architecture Reference

Full doc: `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-18_panya-council-architecture-multi-repo-autonomous-dev.md`

Contains:
1. Panya Council members + roles + ports
2. Multi-repo architecture diagram
3. Directory structures
4. Autonomous workflow
5. Ralph Loop usage
6. GitHub integration (labels, project board)
7. Cost optimization strategy
8. Getting started checklist

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create fm-hvac GitHub repo
- [ ] Setup ATHENA (Director Panya) as first council member
- [ ] Have ATHENA read PRD-FM.md and create initial GitHub Issues
- [ ] Setup GitHub Project board with Panya labels
- [ ] Test: HEPHAESTUS picks issue → writes code → creates PR
