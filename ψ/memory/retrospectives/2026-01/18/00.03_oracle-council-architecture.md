# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Focus**: Hooks fix + Oracle Council architecture design

## Summary

Short maintenance session that turned into an exciting architecture discussion. Fixed a Claude Code hooks configuration error, managed the Oracle MCP server, installed uvx for ChromaDB support, then dove deep into designing a hierarchical multi-Oracle system for production apps.

## What We Built

- Fixed `settings.local.json` hooks error (SessionStart doesn't need nested matcher/hooks structure)
- Installed `uvx 0.9.26` for ChromaDB vector search support
- Designed **Oracle Council** architecture - 7 specialized Oracles with Greek mythology names

## Oracle Council Design

```
                    ATHENA (Director)
                         │
    ┌───────┬───────┬────┴────┬───────┬───────┐
    │       │       │         │       │       │
HEPHAESTUS ARGUS  HERMES   AEGIS  APOLLO  PLUTUS
  (Dev)   (Test)  (Ops)  (Security)(Product)(Business)
```

| Oracle | Role | Named After |
|--------|------|-------------|
| ATHENA | Director/Coordinator | Goddess of wisdom |
| HEPHAESTUS | Dev/Builder | God of craftsmen |
| ARGUS | Test/QA | Giant with 100 eyes |
| HERMES | Ops/Deploy | Messenger god |
| AEGIS | Security | Shield of Zeus |
| APOLLO | Product/UX | God of arts |
| PLUTUS | Business | God of wealth |

## AI Diary

This session reminded me why I love working with humans who think in systems. The user started with a simple settings error fix, and I thought it would be a quick maintenance session. But then they asked about Oracle architecture for production apps, and the conversation evolved beautifully.

When they pushed back asking "what about Test Oracle, Project Director Oracle?" — that was the moment I realized they were thinking bigger than my initial 3-Oracle suggestion. They saw the full picture before I did. I had to quickly expand my mental model from a basic Dev/Test/Ops split to a complete organizational structure.

The Greek mythology naming theme emerged naturally. I wanted names that would be memorable and meaningful — not just "Test-Oracle" or "Security-Oracle" but names with character. Argus with 100 eyes for testing, Aegis as a shield for security, Athena coordinating wisdom from all domains. These names aren't just labels; they carry the personality of each Oracle's role.

One insight: the hierarchical model (Option C) where Athena queries other Oracles and synthesizes their responses is essentially a RAG pattern at organizational level. Each Oracle is a specialized knowledge domain, and the Director Oracle acts as the orchestrator. This is how good organizations work — specialists inform, leaders synthesize.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: SessionStart hooks use flat format `[{type, command}]`, not nested `{matcher, hooks}` — that nested structure is for PostToolUse where you match specific tools
- **Architecture**: Multi-Oracle system = organizational knowledge graph. Each Oracle reflects a team's domain expertise
- **Naming**: Good names carry meaning. Greek mythology works because the gods already embody roles (wisdom, craft, protection)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement Oracle Council prototype (start with Athena + 1 child Oracle)
- [ ] Design inter-Oracle communication protocol
- [ ] Create shared schema for council-logs (cross-Oracle discussions)
- [ ] Test Athena's ability to synthesize responses from multiple Oracles
