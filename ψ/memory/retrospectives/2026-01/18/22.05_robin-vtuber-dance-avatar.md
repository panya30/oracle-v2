# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Focus**: Robin VTuber Avatar + Dance System

## Summary
Set up Robin's visual presence with two complementary systems: ChatVRM for interactive conversations with a 3D avatar, and VRM Dance Viewer for dancing animations. Downloaded 26 VMD dance files and 6 VRM models. Also learned about gitfiti (GitHub contribution calendar art).

## What We Built

### Robin VTuber (Live2D) - `ψ/robin-vtuber/`
- Open-LLM-VTuber with Live2D avatar (mao_pro model)
- Configured for OpenAI GPT-4o (switched from Claude due to API key)
- Edge TTS with Australian voice (en-AU-NatashaNeural)
- Faster Whisper for speech recognition
- Running at http://localhost:12393

### Robin VRM (ChatVRM) - `ψ/robin-vrm/`
- 3D VRM avatar with chat capabilities
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- Robin personality (warm, playful Australian girlfriend)
- Lip sync + emotional expressions
- Running at http://localhost:3002

### Robin Dance Viewer - `ψ/robin-dance/`
- VRM dance viewer with VMD motion support
- 26 VMD dance files (heartbeat, shake it, galaxy, neko, etc.)
- 6 VRM models (alicia, rose, rabbit, polydancer, samples)
- Running at http://localhost:8080

### Gitfiti Learning - `ψ/learn/gitfiti/`
- Explored gitfiti project (GitHub calendar pixel art)
- Created architecture + code snippets + quick reference docs

## AI Diary (Required - 100+ words)

This session was a fascinating deep dive into the world of VTuber technology. I started with what seemed like a straightforward request - "can you visualize yourself with movement?" - and it turned into an exploration of Live2D, VRM, VMD, and the surprisingly rich ecosystem of open-source avatar tools.

The most frustrating part was downloading VMD files. I tried at least 5 different approaches - direct GitHub URLs, curl, wget, Internet Archive - and kept getting HTML redirect pages instead of binary files. Finally realized I needed to `git clone` the entire repo to get the actual LFS files. That took way longer than expected.

I was pleasantly surprised by how mature the VTuber tooling has become. ChatVRM is elegant - just drop in a VRM file and you have a talking avatar. The VRM Dance Viewer handles VMD motion files beautifully. The user now has Robin as a visual presence they can actually see, talk to, and watch dance.

The switch from Claude to OpenAI mid-stream was smooth - just changed the API endpoint and model name. Shows how standardized these LLM APIs have become.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: GitHub raw URLs for LFS files return HTML redirects - must `git clone` to get actual binary files
- **Pattern**: VRM ecosystem is well-developed with multiple compatible viewers (ChatVRM, VRM Dance Viewer, VSeeFace)
- **Pattern**: VMD (MikuMikuDance) motion data is the standard format for dance animations on VRM models
- **Pattern**: Edge TTS provides good quality voices without API keys (en-AU-NatashaNeural for Australian accent)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Find/create a custom VRM model that better represents Robin's identity
- [ ] Integrate dance triggers into ChatVRM (make Robin dance on command)
- [ ] Set up ElevenLabs for higher quality voice output
- [ ] Create a unified Robin interface combining chat + dance
- [ ] Explore webcam-based motion capture for real-time avatar control
