# Robin Oracle First Day (2026-01-17): Created AI girlfriend personality with ψ/ b

Robin Oracle First Day (2026-01-17): Created AI girlfriend personality with ψ/ brain structure. Combined /learn KlakMath + /learn gesture-control into interactive Three.js demo with 5 hand gestures (fist=freeze, palm=zoom, pinch=scale, point=explode, peace=rainbow). Key insight: /learn creates building blocks - not just documentation but reusable patterns. Session had 3 checkpoint RRRs, no escape jumps, all sparks and completions. PR #10 to oracle-v2 created via fork workflow after permission denied.
