## Bond Trading Strategies - Level 4

### Directional Strategies

**BULLISH ON BONDS (expect yields to fall):**
- Buy TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF)
- Buy TMF (3x leveraged long Treasury)
- Buy TLT Call options
- Expected: Rates down → Bond prices up

**BEARISH ON BONDS (expect yields to rise):**
- Buy TBF (1x inverse Treasury)
- Buy TBT (2x inverse Treasury)
- Buy TMV (3x inverse Treasury)
- Buy TLT Put options
- Expected: Rates up → Bond prices down → Inverse ETFs up

### Leveraged ETF Details

**TMV - Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X**
- Tracks INVERSE of long-term Treasuries
- 3X daily leverage
- Rebalances DAILY

**Math Example:**
- TLT Duration = 16.5
- Yields rise 2% → TLT drops ~33%
- TMV (3x inverse) → gains ~100%
- Yields spike 4% in crisis → TLT drops ~66% → TMV gains ~200%

### ⚠️ VOLATILITY DECAY WARNING
Leveraged ETFs suffer decay in sideways markets due to daily rebalancing.

Example:
- Day 1: TLT +5% → TMV -15% ($100 → $85)
- Day 2: TLT -5% → TMV +15% ($85 → $97.75)
- Net: TLT nearly flat, TMV lost $2.25

**Rules for Leveraged ETFs:**
- Only use during strong trends
- Not for long-term holding
- Have clear exit strategy
- Position size carefully

### Options Strategy for 20-30x
TLT Put Options provide asymmetric payoff:
- Limited loss (premium paid)
- Unlimited potential gain
- Higher leverage than ETFs

Example:
- TLT at $88, buy $80 Put for $2.00
- TLT drops to $70 → Put worth $10 → 5x
- TLT drops to $60 → Put worth $20 → 10x
- TLT stays flat → Lose $2.00 premium
