## Bond Market Mechanics - Level 2

### THE GOLDEN RULE
```
YIELD ↑ = PRICE ↓
YIELD ↓ = PRICE ↑
```
This is the most important concept in bond trading.

### Why Inverse Relationship?
When new bonds offer higher yields, old bonds with lower coupons become less attractive → price must drop to compensate → effective yield rises to match market.

### Duration - Sensitivity Measure
Duration measures how much a bond's price changes when yields change.

**Formula:** Duration of X years ≈ X% price change per 1% yield change

| Bond Type | Duration | 1% Yield Rise Impact |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| T-Bill (3m) | ~0.25 | -0.25% |
| T-Note (2Y) | ~2 | -2% |
| T-Note (10Y) | ~8 | -8% |
| T-Bond (30Y) | ~17 | -17% |
| TLT ETF | ~16.5 | -16.5% |

### Yield Curve
- **Normal (upward):** Economy healthy, long yields > short yields
- **Flat:** Uncertainty, transition period
- **Inverted:** Recession signal, short yields > long yields (2Y > 10Y)
- **Steepening:** Recovery expected

### Key Insight
Long Duration = High Risk/Reward
- Expect rates down → Buy long duration (TLT)
- Expect rates up → Short long duration (TMV)
