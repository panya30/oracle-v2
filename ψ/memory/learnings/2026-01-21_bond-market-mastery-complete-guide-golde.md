# ## Bond Market Mastery - Complete Guide

## Bond Market Mastery - Complete Guide

### Golden Rule
YIELD ↑ = PRICE ↓ (inverse relationship)

### Duration Formula
Duration X years = X% price change per 1% yield change
- TLT duration ~16.5 = very sensitive
- T-Bills duration ~0.25 = very stable

### Yield Curve Signals
- Normal (upward): Economy healthy
- Flat: Uncertainty
- Inverted: Recession coming (2Y > 10Y)

### Key Instruments
| Direction | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Bullish (rates down) | TLT | TMF (3x) | TLT Calls |
| Bearish (rates up) | TBF | TBT (2x) | TMV (3x) |

### Leveraged ETF Warning
- Daily rebalancing causes decay in sideways markets
- Only use during strong trends
- Not for long-term holding

### The System Understanding
1. Government borrows → issues bonds
2. Must pay interest → needs more money
3. Issues more bonds → supply up → prices down
4. Yields rise → interest costs rise
5. Eventually: print money or restructure

### Daily Monitoring
- US 10Y yield (benchmark)
- 2Y-10Y spread (recession signal)
- TLT price (bond market health)
- Credit spreads (risk appetite)
