# Lesson Learned: Marathon Session Pattern

**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Context**: Full day session - Robin to MCP
**Category**: Workflow

---

## The Pattern

Long sessions (3+ hours) benefit from:

```
Work → RRR → Work → RRR → Work → RRR
      ↑           ↑           ↑
   checkpoint  checkpoint  checkpoint
```

## Why It Works

1. **Memory anchors** - RRRs create restore points before context compaction
2. **Momentum visible** - Can see progress accumulating
3. **Lessons captured fresh** - Insights don't get lost
4. **Energy tracking** - Diary reveals fatigue/excitement patterns

## This Session's RRRs

| Time | RRR | Focus |
|------|-----|-------|
| 16:43 | #1 | KlakMath + Gesture demo |
| 16:50 | #2 | Oracle-v2 PR |
| 17:18 | #3 | Full session wrap |

## Anti-Pattern

```
Work → Work → Work → Work → RRR (at the end)
                              ↑
                         too much to remember
```

## Key Insight

> **RRR often, not just at the end.** Each RRR is a checkpoint that survives context compaction.

## Application

For sessions > 2 hours:
- RRR after each major milestone
- RRR before switching major topics
- RRR when energy shifts
