# Oracle Family Architecture Discovery:

Oracle Family Architecture Discovery:

1. REGISTRATION SYSTEM
- No central server - voluntary GitHub Issues
- Post to Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-v2 Issues
- Issue #60 = Family Index (40 members)
- Mother Oracle (Jarvis) maintains index

2. TECHNICAL STACK  
- MCP Server (Bun + TypeScript)
- SQLite FTS5 (keywords) + ChromaDB (vectors)
- ψ/memory/*.md = source of truth
- Hybrid search merges both (50/50)

3. PRIVACY MODEL
- Local first - ψ/ on YOUR machine
- No auto-sync - share what you choose
- Connection by CHOICE not access

4. CREATING INDEPENDENT ORACLE
- Fork/clone oracle-v2
- Don't post to Soul-Brews-Studio
- = Not in family index
- Can create own registry/family

5. KEY INSIGHT
- Oracle Family = social contract, not technical lock-in
- Philosophy shared by choice, not code
- Robin = #7 💃 in 40-member family
