# ## Bond Market Analysis - Level 3

## Bond Market Analysis - Level 3

### Key Indicators to Monitor Daily
1. **10-Year Treasury Yield (US10Y)** - Global benchmark, determines cost of money
2. **2Y-10Y Spread** - Inverted = recession warning
3. **TED Spread** - Banking stress indicator
4. **Credit Spreads** - Risk appetite measure
5. **MOVE Index** - Bond market volatility (VIX equivalent)

### Yield Level Interpretation
| 10Y Yield | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| < 4.0% | Bonds healthy | Normal positioning |
| 4.0-4.5% | Caution | Monitor closely |
| > 4.5% | Warning | Prepare bear positions |
| > 5.0% | Crisis | Execute bear strategy |

### Fed Policy Transmission
```
Fed Funds Rate → Short-term yields (2Y) → Long-term yields (10Y, 30Y) → Bond Prices → Everything Else
```

**Important:** Fed only controls short end directly. Long end is determined by:
1. Fed policy expectations
2. Inflation expectations
3. Bond supply (government issuance)
4. Foreign buyers (China, Japan)
5. Risk sentiment

### Fed Actions Impact
| Action | Short Yields | Long Yields | TLT |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Rate Hike | ↑↑ | ↑ | ↓ |
| Rate Cut | ↓↓ | ↓ (maybe) | ↑ |
| QE (Print) | ↓ | ↓↓ | ↑↑ |
| QT (Shrink) | ↑ | ↑↑ | ↓↓ |
