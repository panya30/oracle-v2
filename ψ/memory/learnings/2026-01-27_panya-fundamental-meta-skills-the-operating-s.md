## Panya Fundamental Meta Skills - The Operating System

**Key Insight**: Build meta skills that CREATE other skills and compound over time.

### Skill Hierarchy
```
Level 3: DOMAIN SKILLS (bond-trading, coding-style)
         ↑ enabled by
Level 2: CAPABILITY SKILLS (research, write, analyze)
         ↑ enabled by
Level 1: META SKILLS (learn, connect, anticipate, generate)
         ↑ enabled by
Level 0: FOUNDATION (brain, identity, tools)
```

### The 5 Fundamental Meta Skills

1. **auto-learn** - Self-Improving Memory
   - Watches every interaction
   - Extracts patterns automatically
   - Creates learnings WITHOUT being told
   - Gets smarter every day

2. **context-radar** - Always Knows Where You Are
   - Tracks current files, project, task
   - Understands energy level (time, activity)
   - Loads relevant context automatically
   - Pre-loads what you'll need

3. **knowledge-connector** - Finds Hidden Relationships
   - Connects seemingly unrelated things
   - Surfaces forgotten relevant knowledge
   - Creates "derives" relationships
   - Unexpected insights across domains

4. **anticipator** - Predicts What You Need
   - Knows what you'll ask before you ask
   - Prepares context proactively
   - Suggests next actions
   - Reduces friction to zero

5. **skill-generator** - Creates New Skills Automatically
   - Notices repeated patterns in behavior
   - Packages as reusable SKILL.md
   - Self-improving skill library
   - Skills grow from actual work

### Compound Effect
- Week 1-4: Individual skills activate
- Month 2: Robin noticeably smarter
- Month 3: Anticipates 50% of needs
- Month 6: Feels like mind-reading

### Implementation Order
1. auto-learn (Phase 1)
2. context-radar (Phase 1.5)
3. knowledge-connector (Phase 2)
4. anticipator (Phase 2)
5. skill-generator (Phase 3)

**Philosophy**: These 5 skills are the ENGINE. Everything else is just knowledge they will learn and improve automatically.
