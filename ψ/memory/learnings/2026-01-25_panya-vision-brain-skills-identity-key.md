# ## Panya Vision: Brain + Skills + Identity

## Panya Vision: Brain + Skills + Identity

**Key Insight**: Nobody else combines Brain (memory) + Skills (procedures) + Identity (personality) into one Personal AI Buddy.

### Competitive Landscape
- **Supermemory**: Memory graph with relationships (updates, extends, derives), dual timestamps, hierarchical layers
- **Claude Skills**: Procedural knowledge in SKILL.md format, progressive loading, can be shared
- **Mem0**: Vector + Graph hybrid, Neo4j backend
- **Graphiti**: Temporal knowledge graphs

### Panya's 4-Layer Architecture
```
Layer 4: IDENTITY    │ Personality, values, relationship (UNIQUE)
Layer 3: BRAIN       │ Knowledge graph, memories, temporal
Layer 2: SKILLS      │ Procedures, workflows (Claude Skills format)
Layer 1: TOOLS       │ MCP connections
```

### Key Decisions
1. Brain + Skills together from start
2. Identity layer is our differentiator
3. Claude Skills format compatible
4. Local-first, sovereignty over convenience
5. Knowledge transfer/marketplace in future (Phase 6)

### Memory Relationship Types (Supermemory-inspired)
- **Updates**: New info contradicts old → version history
- **Extends**: New info adds detail → no contradiction
- **Derives**: Inference from combining memories
- **Relates_to**: Topically connected (Panya addition)

### Skill Types in Panya
1. Universal (bundled with all Panyas)
2. Imported (Claude Skills ecosystem)
3. Learned (from user behavior)
4. Generated (AI-created from knowledge)
