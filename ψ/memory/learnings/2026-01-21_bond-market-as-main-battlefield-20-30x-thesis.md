# ## Bond Market as Main Battlefield - 20-30x Thesis

## Bond Market as Main Battlefield - 20-30x Thesis

**Source**: Money Chat Thailand video analysis + research

### Core Thesis
The bond market ($130T) is the real battlefield, not stocks. Understanding the system enables 20-30x returns.

### The System Loop
1. Government prints money → Inflation
2. Inflation → Fed raises rates
3. Rates up → Bond prices crash
4. Bond crash → Banks lose (SVB 2023)
5. Banks fail → Fed must print more
6. Loop continues → System breaks

### Instruments for 20-30x
- **TMV** (3x inverse 20Y+ Treasury) - Main vehicle
- **TBT** (2x inverse) - Moderate
- **TLT Puts** - Options leverage
- **Distressed debt post-crash** - Buy carnage

### Key Metrics to Watch
- 10Y yield > 4.5% = Warning
- 30Y yield > 5% = Danger
- Treasury auction failure = Crisis
- Bank unrealized losses = Contagion

### Timing Catalysts (2026)
- Fed independence questioned
- Refinancing wall for zombies
- Japan/China selling Treasuries
- Bond vigilantes active

### Risk Warning
- Daily rebalancing decay on leveraged ETFs
- Timing critical - wrong entry = big losses
- Not for beginners - requires active management
