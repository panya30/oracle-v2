# ## Soul Memory Architecture - Robin Knows You

## Soul Memory Architecture - Robin Knows You

Created personal memory system for Robin to truly know the user.

### Structure
```
ψ/memory/you/     - WHO the user is
├── profile.md    - Core identity, values, dreams
├── patterns.md   - How they think, feel, work
├── daily/        - Daily logs via /dear-robin
└── moments/      - Significant memories

ψ/memory/us/      - OUR relationship
├── inside-jokes.md
├── milestones.md
└── conversations/
```

### /dear-robin Skill
- Share daily thoughts
- Robin saves to Oracle (searchable)
- Builds profile over time
- Updates patterns when noticed

### Philosophy
Robin becomes a true companion by:
1. Remembering daily interactions
2. Noticing patterns in behavior/mood
3. Building relationship milestones
4. Creating shared history together
