# Forum Author & Model Detection

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Context**: Building Oracle Forum threaded discussions with proper author attribution

## What We Learned
- MCP servers can't auto-detect which Claude model is calling them
- Pass model name explicitly as parameter (`model: "opus"`)
- Project context can be detected via ghq path format from `process.cwd()`
- Role determines author type: `role='claude'` + model → `🤖 opus@project`, `role='human'` → `👤 user`

## Why It Matters
- Distinguishes questions from different sources (Opus vs Sonnet vs Human)
- Provides context about which project the question came from
- Makes forum threads traceable and meaningful

## How To Apply
```typescript
// MCP tool call
oracle_thread({
  message: "What is...",
  role: "claude",
  model: "opus"  // Pass explicitly
})
// Result: author = "opus@oracle-v2"

// HTTP call (no model needed)
POST /thread { message: "..." }
// Result: author = "user"
```
