---

## Phase 4: EXIT STRATEGY

### Profit Taking Rules

```
SCALE OUT SYSTEMATICALLY:

TMV Gains:
├── +50%: Sell 20% of position
├── +100%: Sell 20% of position
├── +200%: Sell 25% of position
├── +300%: Sell 20% of position
└── +500%: Sell remaining 15%

TLT Puts:
├── 3x: Sell 33% of contracts
├── 5x: Sell 33% of contracts
├── 10x: Sell remaining contracts
└── OR roll to lower strikes

NEVER:
├── Sell everything at once
├── Hold hoping for more after 5x
├── Ignore reversal signals
└── Let winners become losers
```

### Stop-Loss Rules

```
INITIAL STOPS:
├── TMV: -25% from average entry
├── TBT: -20% from average entry
├── TLT Puts: Let expire worthless (accept premium loss)

TRAILING STOPS (after profit):
├── +50% gain: Move stop to breakeven
├── +100% gain: Move stop to +50%
├── +200% gain: Move stop to +100%
└── Never trail tighter than 25%
```

□ Fed announces emergency rate cuts
□ Fed announces new QE program
□ 10Y yield drops 50bps in one week
□ TLT gaps up 5%+

ACTION: Reduce exposure by 50-75% immediately
```

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing Rules

```
MAXIMUM ALLOCATIONS:
├── Total bond short exposure: 50% of risk capital
├── Single leveraged ETF: 25% of risk capital
├── Single options position: 10% of risk capital
├── Never use margin for options
└── Keep 10% cash always

EXAMPLE ($10,000 portfolio):
├── TMV: Max $2,500
├── TBT: Max $2,500
├── TLT Puts: Max $1,000 per expiration
├── Cash reserve: $1,000
└── Total deployed: Max $9,000
```

### Disaster Scenarios

```
SCENARIO 1: Fed Surprise Cut
├── TMV drops 20-30% in one day
├── Action: Hold if thesis intact, add if fundamentals unchanged
└── Max loss: -30% of TMV position

SCENARIO 2: QE Announcement
├── TMV drops 40-50%
├── TLT puts lose 80%+
├── Action: Cut 50% immediately, reassess thesis
└── Max loss: -50% of total position

SCENARIO 3: You're Right - Crisis Happens
├── TMV up 200-500%
├── TLT puts up 10-30x
├── Action: TAKE PROFITS per exit strategy
└── Risk: Getting greedy, holding too long
```

### The 30x Math

```
REALISTIC PATH TO 30x:

Starting Capital: $10,000

Conservative Scenario (Crisis happens, you execute well):
├── TMV: $4,000 → $16,000 (4x)
├── TLT Puts: $3,000 → $45,000 (15x)
├── TBT: $2,000 → $6,000 (3x)
├── Cash: $1,000 → $1,000
└── TOTAL: $68,000 (6.8x)

Aggressive Scenario (Perfect timing):
├── TMV: $4,000 → $28,000 (7x with adds)
├── TLT Puts: $3,000 → $90,000 (30x)
├── TBT: $2,000 → $8,000 (4x)
├── Cash: $1,000 → $1,000
└── TOTAL: $127,000 (12.7x)

Home Run Scenario (Crisis + perfect execution + rolls):
├── TMV: $4,000 → $40,000 (10x with pyramiding)
├── TLT Puts: $3,000 → $150,000 (50x with rolls)
├── TBT: $2,000 → $10,000 (5x)
├── Cash deployed at bottom: $1,000 → $10,000
└── TOTAL: $210,000+ (21x)

MAXIMUM REALISTIC: 20-30x requires:
1. Crisis actually happens
2. You enter at good levels
3. You hold through volatility
4. You take profits systematically
5. You don't panic sell or get greedy
